"""Authentication: from an ``Authorization`` header to a :class:`Principal`.

Every service verifies its callers itself and never trusts the gateway
(decision D2). An :class:`Authenticator` holds the configured
:class:`~ldk_core.ports.AuthProvider` plugins and asks the first one that
accepts a credential to verify it.

Access is decided by scope. The web app derives a token's scopes from the
user's role, so a role is a bundle of scopes:

- ``viewer``: ``chat``
- ``user``: ``chat``, ``ingest``
- ``admin``: ``chat``, ``ingest``, ``admin``

``ALLOW_LEGACY_ANONYMOUS`` keeps the pre-v2 behaviour, where any caller could
do anything, for one release. Each anonymous request is logged as a warning.
